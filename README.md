# INST414-Final-Project

Hello,
The final project is on supervised learning, in particular classification:
(1) Please use an appropriate data set of your choice. The minimum size is 1000 rows.
(2) implement and compare the performance of the following algorithms:
  ---- Logistic Regression
  ---- Decision Tree Classification with display of tree with tree.plot_tree or graphviz
  ---- XGBoost with display of feature importance
 ----  Neural Network (Keras)
 ----- Neural Network (Pytorch)

Please pay attention to the fact that we are doing Classification, i.e., the target variable should be discrete / categorical. If it is continuous but bounded, you can cut it into parts and assign integers.
I filtered some classification datasets in Kaggle:

You can play with the filter setting to get different collections of datasets.
Best,
AM
